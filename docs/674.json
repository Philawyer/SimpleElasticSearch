{"id":674,"title":"Bayesian model comparison with un-normalised likelihoods","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291353622_Bayesian_model_comparison_with_un-normalised_likelihoods","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Models for which the likelihood function can be evaluated only up to a\n <br> parameter-dependent unknown normalising constant, such as Markov random field\n <br> models, are used widely in computer science, statistical physics, spatial\n <br> statistics, and network analysis. However, Bayesian analysis of these models\n <br> using standard Monte Carlo methods is not possible due to the intractability of\n <br> their likelihood functions. Several methods that permit exact, or close to\n <br> exact, simulation from the posterior distribution have recently been developed.\n <br> However, estimating the evidence and Bayes' factors (BFs) for these models\n <br> remains challenging in general. This paper describes new random weight\n <br> importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods for estimating BFs that\n <br> use simulation to circumvent the evaluation of the intractable likelihood, and\n <br> compares them to existing methods. In some cases we observe an advantage in the\n <br> use of biased weight estimates. An initial investigation into the theoretical\n <br> and empirical properties of this class of methods is presented. Some support\n <br> for the use of biased estimates is presented, but we advocate caution in the\n <br> use of such estimates.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
