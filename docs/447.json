LDHMMs posit that each sequence is generated by an underlying\n <br> Markov chain process, which are controlled by the corresponding parameters\n <br> (i.e., the initial state vector, transition matrix and the emission matrix).\n <br> These sequence-level latent parameters for each sequence are modeled as latent\n <br> Dirichlet random variables and parameterized by a set of deterministic\n <br> database-level hyper-parameters. Through this way, we expect to model the\n <br> sequence in two levels: the database level by deterministic hyper-parameters\n <br> and the sequence-level by latent parameters. To learn the deterministic\n <br> hyper-parameters and approximate posteriors of parameters in LDHMMs, we propose\n <br> an iterative algorithm under the variational EM framework, which consists of E\n <br> and M steps. We examine two different schemes, the fully-factorized and\n <br> partially-factorized forms, for the framework, based on different assumptions.\n <br> We present empirical results of behavior modeling and sequence classification\n <br> on three real-world data sets, and compare them to other related models. The\n <br> experimental results prove that the proposed LDHMMs produce better\n <br> generalization performance in terms of log-likelihood and deliver competitive\n <br> results on the sequence classification problem.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
