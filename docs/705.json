An approximation based on asymptotics is used as a first step to provide a\n <br> computationally efficient estimate of the probability integral. The importance sampling method utilizes\n <br> information of the integrand at the design points to substantially accelerate the convergence of available\n <br> importance sampling methods that use information from one design point only. Implementation issues\n <br> related to the choice of importance sampling density and sample generation for reducing the variance of\n <br> the estimate are addressed. The computational efficiency and improved accuracy of the proposed methods\n <br> is demonstrated by investigating the reliability of structures equipped with a tuned mass damper for which\n <br> multiple design points are shown to contribute significantly to the value of the reliability integral.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
